                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p> The Mozilla project (see fig 1) started in 1998 by releasing the Netscape browser suite source code. The open-source nature of the project is primarily commendable.
                    After multiple years of development, Mozilla 1.0, released in the year 2002. In the same year the first version of Phoenix, later renamed to Firefox, was released for many people unnoticed.
                    At the moment, more than 90% of the internet browser market was taken by Internet Explorer.<br>
                    Later on, in 2004, Firefox 1.0 was released and succesfully, downloads reached numbers over 100 million. Since then, new versions were frequent and FireFox is still one of the major internetbrowsers in the market.
                    Since its inception, Firefox' goal was to bring choice to the user

                    <p> Firefox usage was at a peak at the fall of 2009 when its share of the browser market consisted of an impressive 32.21%, taking over the position of Internet Explorer 7.
                    Howerever, usage has declined ever since due to a new competitor: Google Chrome. Currently, Firefox has a usage share of around 4 percent, while Chrome's is more in the range of 60-65.

                        <p> FireFox OS was an open-source operating system for mobile phones being developed by the Mozilla Project.
                        It has since been cancelled. It was built using 3 layers: the applicationlayer, Open Web Platform Interface and the infrastucturelayer (<em>Gonk</em>).<br>
                        The first layer consisted of a combination of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. The second contained all of the technological stuff: application programming interfaces.
                        These communicate with the layout-engine known as Gecko. The final layer is the actual operating system which was based on linux
