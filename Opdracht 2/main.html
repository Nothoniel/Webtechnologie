                        <h3>General history about the creation of webbrowsers</h3>
                        <p>The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
                        He then recruited Nicola Pellow to write the Line Mode Browser, which displayed web pages on dumb terminals; it was released in 1991 <a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.  
                        This was back then the only browser, unlike today. The development of webbrowsers went pretty fast after the founding of the WorldWideWeb.
                        In 1993 Mosaic was created, this one allowed images in text. And became the first "mainsteam" browser.  The debut of the well-known Internet Explorer was in  1995.
                        Then in a span of a decade the most used  webbrowsers of these days were created : Google chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. 
                        On this website especially about those 4 popular webbrowsers information can be found<a href = "#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
                        A quick overview of the first version of the previous named webbrowers are shown in table 1 with Opera included, since it also a pretty popular webbrowser.</p>

                <h2>Function</h2>
                <section class = "webpage-content__section__subsection">
                    <h3>General features of a standard browser</h3>
                    <p>Generally every webbrowser has an UI, what  basically is a browser wrapper. It would include an address bar, back and forward buttons, minimize/maximize/exit buttons, tabs, 
                    and the reload page button (seen in fig 1). Although they aren’t technically required, all these elements are usually found on every browser page to ensure usability.
                    The idea behind the working of a webbrowser is that it acts as client/medium that contacts the webbrowser. So when you search something on Google and click on a link 
                    or enter a URL in the address bar, the web server locates and sends the information you just requested to the web browser
                    <a href = "#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

                    <p>The information is getting located by using DNS. DNS makes it possible to have a conversion between a numerical IP addres  and a string.
                    Meaning an user can type in the adress bar of a webbrowser something like "Google.com".  An HTTP request is then send to the web server, 
                    which sends a response with HTML, CSS, and other content files to the browser. 
                    In short the browser communicates with the network to ask for documents that make up a page<a href = "#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

                        <h3>W3C Standards</h3>
                        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium is the standards organization for the web, which has a set of guidelines for browsers to adhere certain to HTML and DOM specifications.
                        Because it’s not a strict set of rules, 
                        they can be interpreted differently by different rendering engines. 
                        This is largely why discrepancies in browser experiences exist. 
                        Browsers can conform the specification while still abiding by their own rules, which can cause compatibility issues<a href = "#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

                        <p> Browsers are still to this day trying to make their browser the best. This competitsion between each browser causes frequent development.
                        Each browser has to adapt to the mobile phone usage and newer versions of html and css are needed to achieve their goal.
                        The competition between the browsers can be noticed by the user through the frequent browser updates 
                        and new version releases that has better speed, security, features, and design.<a href = "#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>
