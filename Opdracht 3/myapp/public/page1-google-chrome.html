                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p> Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google. It was first publicly released on Microsoft Windows on 2008 and later ported to many other platforms 
                    <a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. 
                    According to StatCounter, as of January 2021, Google Chrome controls 66.59% of the global web browser market and has been the most prominent web browser since 2012

                    <h3>Announcement</h3>
                    <p> The Browser was planned to be first announced on September 3, 2008 in the form of a 38-page comic book which was sent to various jounalists and bloggers. 
                    This comic book would explain all the features of the web browser <a href="#footnote-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
                    It didn't go quite as planned though, since the German blogger Philipp Lenssen published a scan of the comic book on his website on september 1, the same day he received it <a href="#footnote-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
                    The project code name "Chrome" was kept as the product name at release. 
                    This name is considered quite ironic though: chrome is often associated with cars and speed, 
                    but the browser was designed to be simplistic in contrast to so-called user interface chrome <a href="#footnote-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>

                <div class = "container--resize">
                    <section class = "webpage-content__section__subsection">
                        <h3>First Release</h3>
                        <p> Google Chrome was first released on September 2, 2008 for Windows XP as a beta version<a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
                        Later that year on December 11, the first stable version was released.
                        Alongside the web browser, Google also published the Chromium source code, which the browser was and still is mostly based on <a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
                        This open source project has made quite the impact on future web browser development since many other browsers, 
                        for example the new version of Microsoft Edge, also known as Chromium edge, have used parts of this source code <a href = "#footnote-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>
                    </section>
                    
                    <section class = "webpage-content__section__subsection">
                        <h3>Chrome OS</h3>
                        <p> Chrome OS is an operating system designed by Google that is based on Gentoo Linux. 
                        The project was first announced on July 7, 2008 as an OS with the Chrome browser as its primary component and with a similar UI design as Chrome <a href = "#footnote-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
                        The operating system would be one in which all applications and user data would be stored in a cloud instead of a hard drive. 
                        The only application installed would therefore be a web browser with other applications like a file explorer and mediaplayer incorporated in it.
                        Laptops running this operating system are also known as Chrome Books.
                        This OS is aimed at users who would use their device almost solely to browse the web, meaning that the main focus lies on speed above all else <a href = "#footnote-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>..
                        Google also requested its partnered hardware manufacturers to use solid-state drives instead of hard disk drives, in order to further increase the speed of the Chrome Books <a href = "#footnote-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. </p>

                    <section class = "webpage-content__section__subsection">
                        <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
                        <p> The latest verion of Google Chrome is currently available for the following platforms:</p>

                        <!-- unordered list of some content -->
                        <ul><li>Microsoft Windows 7 or later; </li> 
                            <li>MacOS 10.11 or later;</li>
                            <li>Android 5.0 and later;</li>
                            <li>iOS 12.0 and later;</li>
                            <li>Linux desktop;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Older versions of these platforms may also have an old version of Google Chrome available, but those versions are no longer supported <a href = "#footnote-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <div class = "container--resize">
                    <section class="webpage-content__section__subsection">
                        <h3>Incognito Mode</h3>
                        <p>The user can choose to open tabs in <i>Incognito Mode</i>. This feature is quite similar to private browsing modes of other web browsers. 
                        When in incognito mode, the browser is unable to permanently store things like cookies, search history, and form inputs. 
                        This is only the case for incognito tabs though, normal tabs the user has opened aside from incognito tabs still store information like normal. 
                        As mentioned when opening a incognito tab though, the user may not be in complete privacy since the user's visited websites, search engines, 
                        organisation or internet service provider may still be able to see their activity
                        <a href = "#footnote-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class = "webpage-content__section__subsection">
                        <h3>Password Management</h3>
                        <p> On various platforms the user can make use of password management. After logging in on a website for example, the user may be asked whether or not they want their login credentials to be saved.<br>
                        On Windows, the user will be asked to enter the master password of the Operating system before accessing the password manager <a href = "#footnote-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.<br>
                        On Linux, passwords can be stored in three different ways:</p>

                        <!-- unordered list of some content -->
                        <ul><li>plain text</li>
                            <li>GNOME Keyring</li>
                            <li>KWallet</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In all 3 the cases the passwords will be stored somewhere on the disk. With plain text as the setting, the passwords are stored unencrypted, while the other two options do encrypt the data.
                        When switching between plain text and an encrypting option, the data is automatically encrypted.
                        The web browser chooses one of the options automatically, based on the current desktop environment, though the setting can be forced to one of the options by using a command-line <a href = "#footnote-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>
                    </section>
                </div>
                <section class = "webpage-content__section__subsection">
                    <h3>Dinosaur game</h3>
                    <p> When a user tries to browse without internet connection, a message with a picture of an 8-bit T-Rex shows up.
                    When the user then presses either the space bar or the up-arrow key or by either clicking or tapping (on mobile) a game launches where the user controls the dinosaur running through a desert.
                    The player can jump with space, up-arrow or a tap on the screen(on mobile). On desktop the dinosaur can also duck when the down-arrow key is pressed.
                    This move set allows the player to dodge obstacles, which are cacti and pterodactyls.
                    The player get a score depending on how long they survive.
                    The game has no particular end, but it does get faster the further the user goes <a href = "#footnote-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>.
                    This easter egg can be blocked on chrome books by an administrator, in order to prevent the user to be distracted from work <a href = "#footnote-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>
