                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <section class = "ContentOfIE_section_subsection">
                    <p> Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google. It was first publicly released on Microsoft Windows in 2008 and later ported to many other platforms <a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. 
                        According to StatCounter, as of January 2021, Google Chrome controls 66.59% of the global web browser market and has been the most prominent web browser since 2012 <a href = "#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <section class = "ContentOfIE_section_subsection">
                    <h3>Announcement</h3>
                    <p> The Browser was first planned to be announced on September 3, 2008 in the form of a 38-page comic book which was sent to various jounalists and bloggers. This comic book would explain all the features of the web browser.
                        It didn't go quite as planned though, since the German blogger Philipp Lenssen published a scan of the comic book on his website on september 1, the same day he received it.
                        The project code name "Chrome" was kept as the product name at release. 
                        This name is considered quite ironic though: chrome is often associated with cars and speed, but the browser was designed to be simplistic in contrast to so-called user interface chrome. </p>

                    <h3>First Release</h3>
                    <p> Google Chrome was first released on September 2, 2008 for Windows XP as a beta version<a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
                        Later that year on December 11, the first stable version was released.
                        Alongside the web browser, Google also published the Chromium source code, which the browser was and still is mostly based upon <a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
                        This open source project has made quite the impact on future web browser development since many other browsers, for example the new version of Microsoft Edge, have used parts of this source code <a href = "#footnote-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

                    <h3>Chrome OS</h3>
                    <p> Chrome OS is an operating system designed by Google that is based on Gentoo Linux. 
                        The project was first announced on July 7, 2008 as an OS with the Chrome browser as its primary component and with a similar UI design as Chrome. 
                        The operating system would be one in which all applications and user data would be stored in a cloud instead of a hard drive. 
                        The only application installed would therefore be a web browser with other applications like a file explorer and mediaplayer incorporated in it.
                        Laptops running this operating system are also known as Chrome Books.
                        This OS is aimed at users who would use their device almost solely to browse the web, meaning that the main focus lies on speed above all else.
                        Google also requested its partnered hardware manufacturers to use solid-state drives instead of hard disk drives, in order to further increase the speed of the Chrome Books. </p>
