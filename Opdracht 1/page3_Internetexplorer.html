                    <p>First of all what is Internet Explorer exactly? It is a World Wide Web <a href = "https://searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com/definition/browser">Browser</a> 
                    that comes bundled with the Microsoft Windows operating system (OS).<br> It is one of the mainstream webbrowsers.<br>
                    IE was the most popular browser from 1999, when it overtook Netscape Navigator, until 2012, when Chrome took the lead

                <h3>Death of Internet Explorer</h3>
                    <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge">Microsoft Edge</a>  was released in 2015. The goal of Edge was that it is going to replace Internet Explorer.<br>
                    But Internet Explorer is still installed in newer versions of Windows , since some older websites do not work with Edge only.<br>
                    Edge is like the better version of IE, since it can use a lot of extensions like Google chrome and works a lot faster too
