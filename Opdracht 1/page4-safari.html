                    <h3>Apple & iOS</h3>
                    <p>Safari web browser is the default for the iPhone, iPad, and macOS. 
                    The first version was created by Apple (seen in fig 1) in 2003 and could also be downloaded on Windows from 2007 to 2012. 
                    Safari is pretty much a exclusive browser of Apple. That is the reason why it is not compatibley these days with Windows.
                    The popularity of the Safari browser is depended on  iPhone and the iPad. 
                    Since Apple products are pretty popular it automatically made Safari popular and have a high usage<a href = "#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

                    <h3>Similarities</h3>
                    <p>Safari is like any other popular browser. Users can browse websites, 
                    bookmark favorites, and open multiple sites in tabs. But it distinguishes itself from the rest by  
                    being the first to support the new HTML 5 standard and having Adobe Flash turned off by default

                    <h3>iCloud Tab Browsing</h3>
                    <p>This feature automatically syncs open tabs across devices with the same iCloud account. 
                    You can view a list of all tabs open on your MacBook while using Safari on the iPhone or iPad. 
                    It's similar to Chrome's bookmark sharing but doesn't require logging in. 
                    This was a few years pretty innovative and original.
                    These days most browsers can do the same thing after linking accounts.

                    <h3>Sharing</h3>
                    <p> Like above this feature still exit, but most browsers are catching up and can do something similar these days.
                    The feature mainly enables users to quickly share a website through messaging, 
                    email, or social media such as Facebook or Twitter. 
                    And it can also directly share with another nearby iPhone, iPad, or Mac using AirDrop.

                    <h3>Reader View</h3>
                    <p>Safari can detect articles and present them in a format that strips out navigation and advertisement in favor of a more readable view. 
                    This view is especially great for websites that load new windows as you scroll 
                    or become unreadable on an iPhone or iPad because of navigation. 
                    In short safari has a sort of in-built add block function.

                    <p> Apple is primarily a laptop and mobile device provider. 
                    That is why they made their browser extremely energy efficient, making it possible to have it open longer thhan 
                    Chrome, Firefox, and other popular browsers (if the same device is used).
